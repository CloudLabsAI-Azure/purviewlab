# Module 06 - Lineage

## Introduction

One of the features of Microsoft Purview is the ability to show the lineage between datasets created by data processes. Data lineage shows how data moves over time and enables you to see how data is used and what changes to data have been made. This visibility helps you to understand, trace back and correct data at the source of origin. Lineage, thus also results into better data quality.

Lineage is typically captured from tools that extract, transform and load data. These ETL tools are, for example, Data Factory, Data Share, and Power BI. They capture the lineage of data as it moves. By scanning these ETL tools you can capture and visualize the lineage in Microsoft Purview.

Microsoft Purview also supports the ability to upload custom lineage. Custom lineage is lineage that you created yourself, for example by uploading metadata using the Microsoft Purview's Atlas REST APIs. Lineage in Purview includes relationships between datasets and processes.

> **Did you know?**
>
> * **Dataset**: A dataset (structured or unstructured) provided as an input to a process. For example, a SQL Table, Azure blob, and files (such as .csv and .xml), are all considered datasets. In the lineage section of Purview, datasets are represented by **rectangular boxes**.
>
> * **Process**: An activity or transformation performed on a dataset is called a process. For example, ADF Copy activity, Data Share snapshot and so on. In the lineage section of Purview, processes are represented by **round-edged boxes**.


## Objectives

* Connect an Azure Data Factory account with an Azure Purview account.
* Trigger a Data Factory pipeline to run so that the lineage metadata can be pushed into Purview.

3. [View Lineage in Azure Purview](#3-view-lineage-in-azure-purview)

## 1. Create an Azure Data Factory Connection in Azure Purview

1. Open the **Microsoft Purview Governance Portal**, navigate to **Management** > **Data Factory** (under Lineage connections) and click **New**.

    > **Note**:To view/add/remove Data Factory connections, you need to be assigned the **Collection admin** role on the root collection.

2. Select your Azure Data Factory account instance from the drop-down menu (e.g. `pvlab-{randomId}-adf`) and click **OK**.

    > **Did you know?**
    >
    > Azure Purview can connect to **multiple** Azure Data Factories but each Azure Data Factory account can only connect to **one** Azure Purview account.

3. Once finished, you should see the Data Factory in a **connected** state.

    ![](../images/module06/M6-T1-S3.png)

4. To confirm that Azure Data Factory has been provided the necessary access, navigate to **Data map** > **Collections** > `YOUR_ROOT_COLLECTION` > **Role assignments**, within **Data curators** you should be able to see the Azure Data Factory managed identity.

    >**Did you know?**
    >
    > When a user creates an Azure Data Factory connection, behind the scenes the Data Factory managed identity is added to the `Data Curator` role. This provides Azure Data Factory the necessary access to push lineage to Azure Purview during a pipeline execution. See [supported Azure Data Factory activities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/purview/how-to-link-azure-data-factory#supported-azure-data-factory-activities) for more information.

## 2. Copy Data using Azure Data Factory

1. Within the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your Azure Data Factory resource and click **Open Azure Data Factory Studio**.
