    > **Did you know?**
    >
    > **Capacity Units** determine the size of the platform and is a **provisioned** (always on) set of resources that is needed to keep the Microsoft Purview platform up and running. 1 Capacity Unit is able to support approximately 25 data map operations per second and includes up to 2GB of metadata storage about data assets.
    >
    > Capacity Units are required regardless of whether you plan to invoke the Microsoft Purview API endpoints directly (i.e. ISV scenario) or indirectly via Purview Studio (GUI).
    >
    > Note: With the introduction of the [Elastic Data Map](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/purview/concept-elastic-data-map), you no longer need to specify how many Capacity Units that you need. Microsoft Purview will scale capacity elastically based on the request load.
    > 
    > **vCore Hours** on the other hand, is the unit of measure for **serverless** compute that is needed to run a scan. You only pay per vCore Hour of scanning that you consume (rounded up to the nearest minute).
    >
    > For more information, check out the [Microsoft Purview Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/azure-purview/) page.
